### Summary

In this challenge, I practiced  web application enumeration and privilege escalation. The process involved finding a vulnerable web service, gaining an initial foothold, and then escalating privileges to root.

### Tools Used

* Nmap
* GoBuster
* Metasploit
* LinPeas

### Lessons Learned

This room was a great refresher on the importance of checking for kernel exploits during privilege escalation. I also learned a new technique for reverse shell stabilization.
