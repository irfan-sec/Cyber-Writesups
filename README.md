# My Cybersecurity Write-ups

Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity write-ups!

This repository serves as a living document of my hands-on learning journey. Here, you will find detailed walkthroughs and notes from the various machines and challenges I have completed on platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**.

My goal is to clearly document my methodology for each challenge, including:
- **Enumeration:** How I gather initial information.
- **Gaining Access:** The steps taken to get an initial foothold.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The techniques used to gain administrative control.
- **Lessons Learned:** Key takeaways and security principles from each box.

Feel free to browse the files to see my work. Each completed machine has its own dedicated `.md` file.
